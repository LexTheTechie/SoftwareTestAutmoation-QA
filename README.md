# SoftwareTestAutmoation-QA

###### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my software is functional and secure via software automation testing. Being able to test the code that I write based on its functionality and code coverage allows me to do this. 

###### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs by going over the requirements provided by the client and figuring out what the best code design will be for the requirements. These requirements are then in or pirated into the program via methods or functions that can be tested for functionality. 

###### How do I approach designing software? 

I approach designing software by assessing the needs of the client and configuring the best coding structure for the program. I keep in mind when creating the code, what methodology I will use when testing the code and try to structure the code accordingly.
